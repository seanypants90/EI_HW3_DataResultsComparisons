Based upon the results of the HAND MODEL compared to real world observations recorded from stream gages from the USGS in the Raritan Basin the accuracy of the model was better at higher flood stages compared to lower ones. Middle Brook stream gage with a 8 meter flood stage modeled extremely well using HAND, while Pike Run modeled improperly compared to real world oberservations with a flood stage of 3 meters. There could be many contributing factors to this such as the catchment size, the courseness of the DEM used, or other factors that the model did not consider (Impermiable surfaces, road networks, and other infrastructure). Despite some data inaccuracies in the model flood stages, the HAND MODEL provides a useful tool to model various flood stages and compare to historical data to determine the potential accuracy of the model for future or other types of events of engineering significance.
